# Advent of Code 2025
This repository contains Python solutions to the 12 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. The purpose of doing this challenge is to refine my scripting skills (hence the use of Python) and have some fun during the holidays. 

# Advent of FPGA
[Advent of FPGA](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/) is Jane Street's seperate event, which challenges you to turn the standard Advent of Code puzzles into synthesizable FPGA circuits. I will try my best to do a couple in SystemVerilog, but I find that a large chunk of the effort is put into parsing the input files, rather than the computational logic.
